# Clustering Short Responses
### About
This repository contains code used for the Semester Project: "Short Response (Tag) Clustering" for the CHILI Lab at EPFL. 

### Data

The dataset can be found in the /moocs_tags file.

In order to run the Semantic Vectors code, you will need to download the VectorDict files from:
1. [vectorDict2.pickle.zip](https://nofile.io/f/XmfzxnAZrYF/vectorDict2.pickle.zip)
2. [vectorDict.pickle.zip](https://nofile.io/f/dxrmeR3YGQO/vectorDict.pickle.zip)
Unzip them, and save them in the /SemanticVectors directory

In order to run the Hypernymy code, you will need to unzip the 2 compressed pickle files in the /Hypernymy Relations directory. Alternatively you can comment out the part that reads the pickles, and run the code to create them. Note: This will be time consuming, and requires an internet connection.
