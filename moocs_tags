i teach the biochemistry and molecular biology courses for medical students at the school of medicine of the universidad autonoma de nuevo leon
mexico.
in general
our classes follow a traditional teaching design and use of technology is practically inexistent (except for videos downloaded from you tube.
i want to learn how to design lessons that are based on the use of different technologies to stimulate critical thinking among the students.
